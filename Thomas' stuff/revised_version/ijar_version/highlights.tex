\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce and define several robust extensions of continuous-time Markov chains.
\item These extensions are able to relax  traditional homogeneity and Markov assumptions.
\item They are also `imprecise', in the sense that they consider set-valued parameters.
\item We present theoretical properties of these imprecise continuous-time Markov chains.
\item We use these properties to design efficient inference algorithms for such models.
\end{itemize}
