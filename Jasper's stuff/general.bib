	vague probability assessments, and to make inferences based on them.
	This model can be given an interpretation in terms of the behaviour
	of a modeller in the face of uncertainty, and is based on Walley's
	theory of imprecise probabilities. It is formally closely related
	to Zadeh's fuzzy probabilities, but it has a different interpretation,
	and a different calculus. Through rationality (coherence) arguments,
	the hierarchical model is shown to lead to an imprecise first-order
	uncertainty model that can be used in decision making, and as a prior
	in statistical reasoning. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	can only be used to define a coherent upper prevision if the associated
	upper probability is 0-1-valued, in which case it moreover coincides
	with the Choquet integral. These results are valid for arbitrary
	coherent upper probabilities, and therefore also relevant for possibility
	theory. It follows from the discussion that in a numerical context,
	the Choquet integral is better suited than the fuzzy integral for
	producing coherent upper previsions starting from possibility measures.
	At the same time, alternative expressions for the Choquet integral
	associated with a possibility measure are derived. Finally, it is
	shown that a possibility measure is fully conglomerable and satisfies
	Walley's regularity axiom for conditioning, ensuring that it can
	be coherently extended to a conditional possibility measure using
	both the methods of natural and regular extension.},

  abstract = {Currently, there is renewed interest in the problem, raised by Shafer
	in 1985, of updating probabilities when observations are incomplete
	(or set-valued). This is a fundamental problem in general, and of
	particular interest for Bayesian networks. Recently, Grunwald and
	Halpern have shown that commonly used updating strategies fail in
	this case, except under very special assumptions. In this paper we
	propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete observations.
	Our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions
	about the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete
	with incomplete observations. We model our ignorance about this mechanism
	by a vacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise
	probabilities, and we use only coherence arguments to turn prior
	into posterior (updated) probabilities. In general, this new approach
	to updating produces lower and upper posterior probabilities and
	previsions (expectations), as well as partially determinate decisions.
	This is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the
	incompleteness mechanism. As an example, we use the new updating
	method to properly address the apparent paradox in the `Monty Hall'
	puzzle. More importantly, we apply it to the problem of classification
	of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads to
	a new, so-called conservative updating rule. In the special case
	of Bayesian networks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide
	an exact algorithm to compare classes based on our updating rule,
	which has linear-time complexity for a class of networks wider than
	polytrees. This result is then extended to the more general framework
	of credal networks, where computations are often much harder than
	with Bayesian nets. Using an example, we show that our rule appears
	to provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations,
	when no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are
	justified.},

  abstract = {We address the (generalized) extension problem for possibility measures:
	given a map defined on a family of(fuzzy) sets, is it possible to
	extend it to a (generalized) possibility measure? The extension problem
	for possibility measures is known to be equivalent to a system of
	sup-T equations, with T a t-norm. A key role is played by the greatest
	solution (of type inf-J, with J a border implicator). When the family
	of sets considered is a semi-partition, another important solution
	(of type sup-T, with T a t-norm) can be identified. In the treatment
	of the generalized possibilistic extension problem, we show that
	a fuzzification of the greatest solution also plays a central role.
	On the other hand, an immediate fuzzification of the sup-T type solution
	is investigated. General necessary and sufficient conditions for
	this fuzzification to be a solution are established. This fuzzification
	is then further discussed in the case of a T-semi-partition or a
	T-partition. Finally, we investigate possible criteria for extendability,
	inspired by Wang's classical criterion of P-consistency. (C) 1998

	possibilistic probabilities and their extension to other events and
	gambles can be performed by finite and exact algorithms. The model
	can furthermore be transformed into an imprecise first-order model,

	decision process to imprecise probabilities. A concept of a generalized
	Markov decision process is defined and motivated. Finite horizon,
	fully observable models with total cumulative reward optimality criterion
	are studied. The imprecision in the model opens up a possibility
	of indecision. A solution procedure, that generalizes the backward
	induction method from the classical theory, is developed. This procedure
	finds all maximal (i.e., undominated) policies for a given generalized
	Markov decision process. An example illustrating the solution method
	is given. The directions for further research are discussed. (C)

  month = jan,
  abstract = {This study extends the framework of partially observable Markov decision
	processes (POMDPs) to allow their parameters, i.e., the probability
	values in the state transition functions and the observation functions,
	to be imprecisely specified. It is shown that this extension can
	reduce the computational costs associated with the solution of these
	problems. First, the new framework, POMDPs with imprecise parameters
	(POMDPIPs), is formulated. We consider (1) the interval case, in
	which each parameter is imprecisely specified by an interval that
	indicates possible values of the parameter, and (2) the point-set
	case, in which each probability distribution is imprecisely specified
	by a set of possible distributions. Second, a new optimality criterion
	for POMDPIPs is introduced. As in POMDPs, the criterion is to regard
	a policy, i.e., an action-selection rule, as optimal if it maximizes
	the expected total reward. The expected total reward, however, cannot
	be calculated precisely in POMDPIPs, because of the parameter imprecision.
	Instead, we estimate the total reward by adopting arbitrary second-order
	beliefs, i.e., beliefs in the imprecisely specified state transition
	functions and observation functions. Although there are many possible
	choices for these second-order beliefs, we regard a policy as optimal
	as long as there is at least one of such choices with which the policy
	maximizes the total reward. Thus there can be multiple optimal policies
	for a POMDPIP. We regard these policies as equally optimal, and aim
	at obtaining one of them. By appropriately choosing which second-order
	beliefs to use in estimating the total reward, computational costs
	incurred in obtaining such an optimal policy can be reduced significantly.
	We provide an exact solution algorithm for POMDPIPs that does this
	efficiently. Third, the performance of such an optimal policy, as
	well as the computational complexity of the algorithm, are analyzed
	theoretically. Last, empirical studies show that our algorithm quickly
	obtains satisfactory policies to many POMDPIPs. (c) 2007 Elsevier

  abstract = {Optimal solutions to Markov decision problems may be very sensitive
	with respect to the state transition probabilities. In many practical
	problems, the estimation of these probabilities is far from accurate.
	Hence, estimation errors are limiting factors in applying Markov
	decision processes to real-world problems.We consider a robust control
	problem for a finite-state, finite-action Markov decision process,
	where uncertainty on the transition matrices is described in terms
	of possibly nonconvex sets. We show that perfect duality holds for
	this problem, and that as a consequence, it can be solved with a
	variant of the classical dynamic programming algorithm, the "robust
	dynamic programming" algorithm. We show that a particular choice
	of the uncertainty sets, involving likelihood regions or entropy
	bounds, leads to both a statistically accurate representation of
	uncertainty, and a complexity of the robust recursion that is almost
	the same as that of the classical recursion. Hence, robustness can
	be added at practically no extra computing cost. We derive similar
	results for other uncertainty sets, including one with a finite number
	of possible values for the transition matrices.We describe in a practical
	path planning example the benefits of using a robust strategy instead
	of the classical optimal strategy; even if the uncertainty level
	is only crudely guessed, the robust strategy yields a much better
	worst-case expected travel time.},

	The sets formed by all the lower probabilities satisfying zero or

	and the Bayesian formulation are considered. In the game-theoretic
	formulation, variants of a policy-iteration algorithm are provided

	algorithm is discussed for the Bayesian formulation where upper and

	toward the structural axioms that cannot be regarded as axioms of
	pure rationality and the general results that yield exact measurement

	probability are introduced to provide a theory of inexact measurement
	of subjective probability. Only minor modifications of de Finetti's
	qualitative axioms yield the desired theory. The paper concludes
	with a comparison of the measurement of belief to the measurement
	results characteristic of Euclidean geometry, and also examines briefly
	some possibilities for using learning models as simplified abstract
	processes for constructing belief.},

  abstract = {This paper compares four measures that have been advocated as models
	for uncertainty in expert systems. The measures are additive probabilities
	(used in the Bayesian theory), coherent lower (or upper) previsions,
	belief functions (used in the Dempster-Shafer theory) and possibility
	measures (fuzzy logic). Special emphasis is given to the theory of
	coherent lower previsions, in which upper and lower probabilities,
	expectations and conditional probabilities are constructed from initial
	assessments through a technique of natural extension. Mathematically,
	all the measures can be regarded as types of coherent lower or upper
	previsions, and this perspective gives some insight into the properties
	of belief functions and possibility measures. The measures are evaluated
	according to six criteria: clarity of interpretation; ability to
	model partial information and imprecise assessments, especially judgements
	expressed in natural language; rules for combining and updating uncertainty,
	and their justification; consistency of models and inferences; feasibility
	of assessment; and feasibility of computations. Each of the four
	measures seems to be useful in special kinds of problems, but only
	lower and upper previsions appear to be sufficiently general to model
	the most common types of uncertainty.},

  year = {2001},
  volume = {134},
  pages = {1--37},
  abstract = {The paper discusses the problem of modelling linguistic uncertainty,
	which is the uncertainty produced by statements in natural language.
	For example, the vague statement 'Mary is young' produces uncertainty
	about Mary's age. We concentrate on simple affirmative statements
	of the type 'subject is predicate', where the predicate satisfies
	a special condition called monotonicity. For this case, we model
	linguistic uncertainty in terms of upper probabilities, which are
	given a behavioural interpretation as betting rates. Possibility
	measures and probability measures are special types of upper probability
	measure. We evaluate Zadeh's suggestion that possibility measures
	should be used to model linguistic uncertainty and the Bayesian claim
	that probability measures should be used. Our main conclusion is
	that, when the predicate is monotonic, possibility measures are appropriate
	models for linguistic uncertainty. We also discuss several assessment
	strategies for constructing a numerical model. (C) 2001 Elsevier
